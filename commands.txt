# COMMANDS START HERE
# Set recommendation algorithm to KNearestNeighbours (not needed, KNN is the default)
set_algorithm KNN

# Set distance strategy to euclidean (not needed, Euclidean is the default)
set_distance Euclidean

# Evaluate the model
evaluate

# Set recommendation algorithm to KMeans+SlopeOne
set_algorithm KMS1

# The first time that KMS1 is used, it will build the clusters (it will be slower)
evaluate

# Set distance strategy to manhattan
set_distance Manhattan

# Evaluate the model again (it will be faster)
evaluate

echo DONE!
